Who We Are
theCoderSchool is the #1 after-school coding program in Silicon Valley. The future will be ever more dependent on technology so let's get our young generation ready. Learn to Code, Change the World. 

http://pleasanton.thecoderschool.com

Job Summary
theCoderSchool is looking for passionate Code Coaches to teach our next generation how to change the world! You will meet incredible kids, teach them how to code (and how to think like a coder!), and be rewarded with an amazing experience. This is a part-time position for 2-20 hours/week (same times weekly), depending on your schedule. Our open hours will be generally 3:30-7:30pm on select weekdays and Saturday. We will provide Instructor Training, and will use more of a ""teaching methodology"" than a curriculum. Much of our teaching will be reverse-engineering games or concepts, and will adapt to a particular student's interests and skills.

Responsibilities
A Code Coach is a mentor who teaches kids how to code. At theCoderSchool, we have three basic teaching styles - your assignment will depend on schedule, ability, and desire.
1. Private and Semi-Private Tutoring. One-to-one or one-to-few coding lessons for kids. Typically in Scratch/Snap for the younger kids and Javascript/HTML, Python and beyond for older kids. Specialty programming like Unity or Swift helpful as well!
2. Plus Session. Teach a group of 10+ year olds how to present their ideas like Steve Jobs. This group session gives our students a chance to play logic games, prepare for their presentation at the quarterly Coder Fairs, and inspire each other.
3. Code Class. Certain coaches that can manage a group of kids will be asked to inspire 7-10 year olds in Code Class. This has a fixed-curriculum for drag-and-drop languages that you'll teach in a classroom style.

This position rocks because you will:
* Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are ready to learn, and potentially manage a team of kids to create an application.
* Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in Silicon Valley.
* Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology

Requirements
What do we want from you? Read on.
* PASSION. All caps! You ooze excitement for technology; you can't wait to play with the latest 3D gaming platform. Your students must be inspired by your energy and enthusiasm :)
* Great Communicator. There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course it's often necessary to explain concepts in a few different ways!
* Kid at heart. Our best coaches understand what gets kids excited because they love the same things: gamers please apply!
* Coding Skills. Strong grasp of basic procedural programming. General knowledge of one or more languages is assumed - Javascript, PHP, HTML/CSS, Python, Java are most helpful. Deep technical skills aren't necessarily required - we prefer you communicate and empathize well with your students. 
* Big bonus for game development and app development: Unity especially.
* Experience teaching kids is a plus

Interested? Send us an email with a cover letter and resume. Let's do this!    ",6754 Bernal Ave,TBD depending on experience

Job Summary
-----------------
theCoderSchool is looking for passionate Code Coaches to teach our next generation how to change the world!

This is a part-time position for anywhere from 2-15 hours/week (same times weekly), depending on your schedule and availability.

These hours can generally be sometime between 3-8pm weekdays and 10am-5pm on Saturday and Sunday.


Responsibilities
-------------------
A Code Coach is a mentor who teaches kids how to code. At theCoderSchool, we have three basic teaching styles - your assignment will depend on schedule, ability, and desire.

1. Private and Semi-Private Tutoring. One-on-one or one-on-two coding lessons for kids. Younger kids will be taught in Scratch or Snap, while older kids gravitate towards more advanced platforms. The kids will generally create projects that you decide with them, and generally follow our curriculum.

2. Code Coaching Plus. Our more experienced Code Coaches will manage a team of kids who will collaborate to create a project together. Requirements, design, iterations - similar to a real development but with more fun team challenges and activities mixed in.

3. Code Class. Traditional curriculum based classes with a larger student to teacher ratio, where all students follow a set specific curriculum.

This position rocks because you will:
• Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are ready to be our next generation of coders!
• Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in the Bay Area.
• Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology
• Have the flexibility to teach what you're most comfortable with, and learn new things along the way

Requirements
-----------------
What do we want from you? Read on.

• PASSION. All caps! This is all about giving back to the kids. We need to see goose bumps when your student ROCKS a code challenge.

• Great Communicator. There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course patience is a virtue when it comes to kids!

• Street Cred. Our college-level Code Coaches will have Comp Sci or Engineering or similar major at a nearby accredited school. Our Veteran Code Coaches will have relevant industry experience.

• Coding Skills. Strong grasp of general technologies, proficient coder and uber-logical thinker. General knowledge of hardware prototyping using Arduino or similar, 3D printing and robotics are most helpful. Deep technical skills aren't required - we prefer you communicate well and find answers along with students than know everything upfront.

Together with our partners, we are committed to Asia's continued development as a peaceful, just, and thriving region of the world.

The Asia Foundation's Books for Asia program seeks a Senior Program Manager to help expand its Let's Read! initiative.  Let's Read! draws on The Asia Foundation's in-country capabilities, local partnerships, and technological expertise to empower communities to create, translate, and share high-quality, richly illustrated children's books. Let's Read's multi-lingual, digital collection and community-driven strategy are designed to spark a lifelong love of reading throughout Asia.

Let's Read! is more than a digital library--it is a quick and cost-effective approach to solving the problem of book scarcity in local languages and in remote or underserved communities. Our digital library website and app - fueled by workshops that create and translate books in local languages - put stories directly into the hands of children, parents, teachers, and communities. Books in the Let's Read! library carry a Creative Commons license, allowing them to be read, downloaded, printed, and shared with very few restrictions.

In the last 18 months, the Let's Read! initiative has been implemented in five countries and the digital library has grown to 1,400 books in 15 languages.  In collaboration with local partners, over 600 writers, illustrators, editors, and volunteer translators have been trained during this time.  By early 2019, we expect to scale the initiative to 10 countries and the digital library to 20 languages.  

SUMMARY OF JOB ACCOUNTABILITIES

The responsibilities include, creatively contributing as a member of the Let's Read! senior management team, to strategize decisions related to Let's Read!, including strategic partnerships, implementation, tech development, outreach and communications, and fundraising.  The Senior Program Manager will handle a portfolio of countries and collaborate with local staff and partners to design or expand country-specific 
implementation plans to increase content, promote reading, raise visibility and grow user adoption of the Let's Read! web app and Android app. The Senior Program Manager will train, coach, and mentor in-country staff and facilitate workshops with partners and, in some cases, children's book editors and translators.  S/he will be responsible for routinely monitoring and reporting on Let's Read! user analytics and writing concept notes and proposals to attract funding to scale Let's Read! S/he will assist with tasks related to digital library maintenance such as tagging content and uploading EPUBs. 

The Senior Manager for Let's Read! will report to the Assistant Director, Books for Asia. S/he will coordinate closely with Asia Foundation/BFA staff based in country offices, as well as with country directors and deputy country directors.  In TAF headquarters, the Senior Manager will communicate with Programs, Global Communications, and Resource Development units.  S/he will occasionally represent Books for Asia at conferences in the US and abroad.

Find & Join The Best Rocket Ship Startups,https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sof/d/find-join-the-best-rocket/6669008698.html,1534049880000,,"
        
Spending a month picking the right startup to work for can be more impactful than spending a lifetime working at an average company. We're here to help you pick and land engineering jobs at the best startups. So here's a list of the best startups to join. If you're a software engineer, we'll even help you get jobs at these companies.

https://www.futureengine.org

Our founders and investors joined rocket ship companies including Facebook and Google early. The outcomes were life changing. But historically, not everyone gets early access to rocket ships. We're leveling the playing field by providing everyone equal access to rocket ship opportunities.

How did we pick which companies got on our list? We used the same system that top venture capital firms use. I.e., we picked companies that are already growing really really fast. We also look at a few other factors (more details at the link), but the dominant factor is growth trajectory. And hypergrowth is exactly why we personally decided to join Facebook and Google early on.

We've seen a lot of talented people join terrible startups. This is not fun for several reasons. Working at startups is way harder than working at big companies. Startups usually can't pay as well on a cash basis as big companies. And the most productive years of one's life are a very limited resource. So you've got to be careful how you spend those years.

In contrast, when you pick the right startup to work for, the result can be a cascade of positive outcomes in terms of career, network and financial outcomes.

Per Sheryl Sandberg: ""If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship, don't ask what seat! Just get on.""

And per Paul Graham (founder of Y Combinator), growth trumps everything else: ""A startup is a company designed to grow fast... The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth."" [http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html]

We hope this list is helpful because joining a startup randomly is a terrible idea. 70% of startups that receive a seed round go nowhere and only 1% become unicorns (https://www.cbinsights.com/research/venture-capital-funnel-2/). If you join a startup before seed, odds are even worse.

So whatever you do, be thoughtful about picking the right startup to join. And we hope this free resource can give you a head start:
